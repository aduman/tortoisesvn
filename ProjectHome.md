**TortoiseSVN** is an easy-to-use SCM / source control software for Microsoft Windows and possibly the best standalone [Subversion](http://subversion.apache.org/) client there is. It is implemented as a Windows shell extension, which makes it integrate seamlessly into the Windows explorer. Since it's not an integration for a specific IDE you can use it with whatever development tools you like.

It's not only web and software developers who can benefit. Another advantage of this shell integration is that it can be used by people who don't have all the development tools installed, for example translators, doc writers, ...

**TortoiseSVN** provides a nice context menu which allows you to access all Subversion functions.
